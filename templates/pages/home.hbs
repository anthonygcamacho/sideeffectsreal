    <h3>About #SideEffectsReal</h3>
    <div class="about-home__content-wrapper">
        <p>The doctors have been sweeping the C-19 vaccine side effect cases under the rug since the release of the vaccines, calling the cases "rare", leaving the patients with no where to turn.</p>
        <p>Washington isn't putting up a fight for those that are stuck with these side effects. So it's time to take the protest back to the doctors and make them answer.</p>
        <p>It's time to bring the protest right in front of the hospitals, the doctors workplace. It will help to get in front of the patients who are feeling left out in the cold and don't know who go to for help.</p>
        <p>Lastly, this has to be said... This is a peaceful protest, but let's get out there like we mean it.</p>
