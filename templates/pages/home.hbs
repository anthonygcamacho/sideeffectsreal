    <h2>About #CancelTheirHealthcare</h2>
    <div class="about-home__content-wrapper">
        <p>100% of our Representatives in Washington, DC are receiving the best employer provided healthcare coverage in the country. Their incomes is provided from our taxes. We vote to give them a job and our taxes pay their salary. We are their employer.</p>
        <p>We are PEACEFULLY requesting that ALL of our Representatives in Washington, DC cancel the healthcare coverage we are providing them, until they are able to find a solution (public or private), that has an end result of insuring 100% of all American citizens and tax payers first.</p>
        <p>After 100% of American citizens are receiving the same, or better, healthcare coverage than our Representatives are receiving currently, can our Representatives then receive healthcare coverage for them and their famiies.</p>
        <p>All our Representatives in Washington DC will pay 100% of their health treatments and medication out of pocket, with no help from any healthcare  coverage provider of any kind, until the 100% of American citizens are covered first.</p>
        <p>This is an American People's First Initiative.</p>
